# Validate CPF üõ†

Check if a CPF is valid or not.

## üöÄ Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## ‚Ñπ Description/Important notes

It was a class that I've learned about 'Class' in a course on the 'Udemy Courses', called "Curso de JavaScript e TypeScript do b√°sico ao avan√ßado 2021
" made by the developer and mentor:
- Luiz Ot√°vio Miranda üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I totally recommend this course if you want to learn principally about JS, node, typeScript and much more. Look how many topics he teaches, link below: https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-de-javascript-moderno-do-basico-ao-avancado/

My intention in this project was to learn how a CPF can be validated and practice Class on JavaScript.

I just did the "Controller", HTML and CSS, because the course doesn't have HTML and CSS. You can see below:

```javascript
/*
=========CONTROLLER==========
*/

const validateButton = document.querySelector('.submit');
const cpfSent = document.querySelector('.cpf');
const result = document.querySelector('.screen');

validateButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
  let newValidateCPF = new validateCPF(cpfSent.value);
  if(newValidateCPF.validate()){
    result.value = 'CPF V√ÅLIDO'
  }else {
    result.value = 'CPF INV√ÅLIDO'
  }
});
```

Well, it's not everything about the project, but I just want to bring here what I did differently to practice what I have been learning!

## üìå But what is CPF and how do you validate a CPF?
The CPF is the Individual Taxpayer Registry. It is a document made by the Federal Revenue and serves to identify taxpayers. </br>
The CPF is a number with 11 digits, which only changes by court decision. </br>
</br>
To validate one CPF is necessary make a calculus with the 9 first numbers, you can see better bellow:
I will show giving an example:

CPF example: 705.484.450-52
First, it's necessary to get the nine first numbers and multiply like below:

<table>
<tr>
  <td>CPF</td>
  <td>MULTIPLIER</td>
  <td>RESULT</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>7</td>
  <td>10</td>
  <td>70</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>9</td>
  <td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>5</td>
  <td>8</td>
  <td>40</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>4</td>
  <td>7</td>
  <td>28</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>8</td>
  <td>6</td>
  <td>48</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>4</td>
  <td>5</td>
  <td>20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>4</td>
  <td>4</td>
  <td>16</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>5</td>
  <td>3</td>
  <td>15</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>2</td>
  <td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>237 (sum of all results)</td>
</tr>
</table>

The calculus to get the first digit is: </br>
11 - (237 % 11) = 5 (First digit) </br>
If the digit number is greater than 9, we consider 0.
</br>
</br>
Now that we have the first digit, the second digit is the same thing, but the multiplier start with the number 11 as below:
<table>
<tr>
  <td>CPF</td>
  <td>MULTIPLIER</td>
  <td>RESULT</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>7</td>
  <td>11</td>
  <td>77</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>10</td>
  <td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>5</td>
  <td>9</td>
  <td>45</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>4</td>
  <td>8</td>
  <td>32</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>8</td>
  <td>7</td>
  <td>56</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>4</td>
  <td>6</td>
  <td>24</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>4</td>
  <td>5</td>
  <td>20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>5</td>
  <td>4</td>
  <td>20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>3</td>
  <td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>5</td>
  <td>2</td>
  <td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>--</td>
  <td>284 (sum of all results)</td>
</tr>
</table>

The calculus to get the second digit is: </br>
11 - (284 % 11) = 2 (First digit) </br>
If the digit number is greater than 9, we consider 0.
</br>
</br>
Now we have both digits to check our CPF: </br>
First Digit = 5 </br>
Second Digit = 2 </br>
</br>
